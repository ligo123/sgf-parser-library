#The introduction to the SGF parser library project

# Why? #

I love Go and I love programming, so I love programming Go games, viewers and clients. but avery time i write a new parser because i've changed language or i've found some better way to do it and because of that lost pf time i never finish a game so I've decided to build a library of multiple language SGF parser to help and be help on those parsers.

I've been inspired by JSON, because they've put a big list of JSON parser on the project page, but since I don't own the SGF format nor there web site i've decided to build a full library with the help of my fellow programmer friends.


# How? #

It's simple, the goal is to build a nice binary tree in memory from the SGF, every language with the support of objects while be simple to support. For others we will have to build structures and program a browser, so it will be more difficult for the first but most of others should look alike.

# When? #

Now and for ever.
